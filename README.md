# Random Forest with Standard Scaler for Predictive Modeling

This repository provides a Python implementation of the Random Forest algorithm, incorporating Standard Scaler for feature preprocessing, for predictive modeling tasks.

## Purpose:

* Demonstrates the application of Random Forest for regression or classification.
* Illustrates the importance of feature scaling using Standard Scaler.
* Provides a foundation for understanding ensemble learning and feature preprocessing techniques.

## Implementation:

* Uses Python's `scikit-learn` library to implement Random Forest.
* Applies Standard Scaler for feature scaling before model training.
* Allows for customization of Random Forest parameters (e.g., number of trees, max depth).
* Provides functionality for model evaluation (e.g., accuracy, RMSE, R-squared).

## Usage:

1.  Install necessary Python packages (e.g., `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`).
2.  Input your dataset (features and target variable).
3.  Run the provided Python script (`random_forest_scaler.py`).
4.  Specify any desired Random Forest parameters.
5.  Interpret output:
    * The script outputs the model's performance metrics (accuracy, RMSE, R-squared, etc.).
    * Feature importance is visualized to understand which features drive predictions.
    * Predictions are provided for the test set.

## Key Concepts:

* **Random Forest:** An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees.
* **Standard Scaler:** A feature scaling technique that standardizes features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.
* **Feature Scaling:** Transforming numerical features to a similar scale.
* **Ensemble Learning:** Combining multiple models to improve prediction accuracy.
* **Feature Importance:** Determining the relevance of each feature in the model's predictions.

## Output:

* Model performance metrics (accuracy, RMSE, R-squared, etc.).
* Feature importance visualizations.
* Predictions on the test set.
* Information about the parameters used (number of trees, max depth, etc.).
